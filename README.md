# Indeed-Apply-Bot_ChatGPT-Auto-Iteration
**Indeed Auto Apply / Check Reviews**
**ChatGPT Automatic Iteration - get the best results per prompt**

Frustrated that Indeed's "Easily Apply" has slowly turned into the opposite of easy? Welcome aboard.

Indeed Bot - This script automatically checks reviews and/or applies to specified job applications on Indeed **+** automatically answers custom questions from employers via user input while defaulting to ChatGPT when input is missing. Job types and job details can be excluded as long as the keyword is listed within the job title or job description. Review Check choices are: automatically per job or manually for the entire page of jobs.

This script utilizes AutoHotKey v2 to mimic user input (the whole point of using AHK here), thus allowing the user to remain compliant with both Indeed's and OpenAI's TOS. The Indeed script also includes mouse click boundaries (avoids clicking the same spot) random wait times between certain interactions to allow for load times on older PC's / avoid Indeed's rate limiting to a large degree.

**I will not know of every issue that exists, so please create an "issue" when you run into problems."

**BEWARE: Do NOT leave this script running when playing online games that have Anti-Cheat enabled! As with all scripts for some games, the risk is always there.**

**This script currently only works on Windows PC + Chrome browser. As well, using ChatGPT via incognito window is currently disabled within the script. If this becomes a problem, please create an "issue".**

**Cover Letters are currently not supported**

**Indeed limits users to roughly 45 applications per hour before automatically rate limiting.**

**Collaborators: Please create an "issue" to request Collaborator access**
